ðŸ§  Reflections
- This week was all about ramping up and adjusting to the hybrid setup. I learned how build pipelines work. I also realized the value of standups in keeping the team in syncâ€”even when remote. The most challenging part was getting used to the enterprise security protocols, but it's been a great learning experience in understanding how large organizations handle security and access control.

- Looking forward to next week, I hope to complete the authentication changes and dive deeper into the CI/CD documentation. The team has been really supportive, and I'm excited to contribute more to the projects.
